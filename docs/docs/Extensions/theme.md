# Themes (Beta)

## Get Started

![Theme demo](/img/docs/themed-xplorer.webp)

The Theme extension is a way to define the look of the Xplorer. Xplorer comes with a few default themes (which are `light`, `dark`, `light+`, and `dark+`), but you can also create your own, which is a great way to personalize your Xplorer and is documented in [this guide](/docs/Extensions/create).

You can switch between themes by opening settings and on the Preference page, you can see a dropdown menu with the available themes under `App Theme` section.

## Installing a theme

There are 2 ways to install a theme:

### Via `.xtension` file

You can download `.xtension` file from the theme developer and simply double clicking it on Xplorer.
